The state of the machine is unchanged. 82 6chapter Trap\u2019s in RISC-V Trap is a speci\ufb01c scenario caused by a exceptional condition or interrupt. In RISC-V, the term trap refers to, transfer of control to a trap handler caused either by an exception or an interrupt. Exception is an unusual condition occurring at run time of an instruction in the current RISC- V hart. An exception disrupts the normal \ufb02ow of instruction execution. Exceptions are usually synchronous. Interrupts are another form of a trap, where the origin of interrupt is from Timer or peripherals. Interrupt is a scenario designed to service a speci\ufb01c external input. All the Traps can be handled or ignored. It is upto the software to decide. A \u201ctrap handler\u201d is a subroutine that handles the trap in a software. The way of handling a trap is left to the software designer and varies from one type of trap to another.[/INST] nop 81</s>"}
